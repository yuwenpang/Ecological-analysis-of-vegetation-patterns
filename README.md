# 1 Objectives
This projects aims to explore vegetation community patterns with ecological analysis, including ordination and fuzzy c-mean clustering.
Basically, within the project, I used the field vegetation inventoies data, i.e., vegetation community. In the field, we firstly identified the plant speices and then estimated their %-coverage independently. The source data saved in 'lom18_spe_mds_v1.csv' and 'lom18_spe_mds_v2.csv' (excluded the non-vegetation component).

# 2 Ecological analysis
The ecological statistic analysis aims to ordination the vegetation community and then to gather plots into (k) clusters.
## 2.1 Non-constrain multidimensional scaling (nMDS)
